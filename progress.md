Project Abstract (2 pts)
(Brief restatement of your projectâ€™s main goal. Max 300 words).

ResGuard is a dynamic resource management system designed to monitor and control system resources (CPU, memory, disk, network) effectively. It aims to prevent system overloads and ensure fair resource distribution among concurrent tasks, potentially utilizing Banker's Algorithm for safe state checking. The system features a desktop application for detailed monitoring and management, a web dashboard for remote oversight, a configurable alerting system to notify users of critical resource levels, and an auto-scaling mechanism to adapt to varying workloads. The goal is to provide a robust and user-friendly platform for managing system resources efficiently.

Updated Project Approach and Architecture (2 pts)
(Describe your current approach, including system design, communication protocols, libraries used, etc. Max 300 words).

The system is built with a modular Python backend.
**System Design:**
-   `SystemMonitor`: Uses `psutil` for real-time collection of CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics.
-   `ResourceManager`: Manages resource allocation, likely implementing Banker's algorithm for deadlock avoidance.
-   `ThreadManager`: Handles concurrent execution of tasks, ensuring they request and release resources through the `ResourceManager`.
-   `AlertingSystem`: Monitors resource usage against user-defined thresholds and generates alerts.
-   `AutoScaler`: (Optional, if fully implemented) Adjusts resource allocations based on predefined rules or reactive monitoring.
-   `Config`: Manages system configuration via a `config.json` file, allowing customization of various parameters.
-   **Desktop Application**: Built with `tkinter`, providing a GUI for monitoring, resource requests, and settings management.
-   **Web Dashboard**: Built with `Flask` and `Dash`/`Plotly` for remote monitoring.

**Communication Protocols:** Internal components interact via Python object methods. The web dashboard uses HTTP/S.

**Libraries Used:** `psutil`, `tkinter`, `Flask`, `Dash`, `Plotly`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `requests`, `jinja2`.

Progress Overview (2 pts)
(Summarize how much of the project is done, what's behind schedule, what's ahead of schedule. Max 200 words).

The project has made significant progress, with core backend functionalities (monitoring, resource management, task handling, alerting, configuration) largely implemented. The desktop application provides a robust interface for most features. The web dashboard's foundational elements are in place.
Key areas for upcoming focus include completing the web dashboard's interactivity, thorough testing across all modules, and refining advanced features like auto-scaling. Documentation and final polish are also pending.
(Team to specify if any parts are ahead or behind schedule).
